# FlyVPN FOSS VPN  
## Introduction  
FlyVPN is a lightweight and speedy VPN. Using the military-grade encryption protocol, AES-256, we have created a VPN that is both fast, secure, and easy to use.

### Installing  
1. Using one of the supported VPN clients, import [FlyVPN.yml](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SilkArt/FlyVPN/main/flyvpn.yml)  
2. Choose Automatic Mode, which will automatically pick a VPN server that's fastest for you, or choose Manual Mode, which you can select a VPN server.  
Recommended usages for each mode:  
Automatic:  
- Gaming (you'll need low ping, latency, high download/upload speeds, and no lag)  
- Torrenting (you'll need fast P2P connections)  
Manual:  
- Streaming (to bypass geo-restrictions, our servers are fast enough to avoid buffering and lag)  
3. Connect and enjoy!  
Note: FlyVPN currently only works on Clash-enabled clients. We are hoping to fix this soon.  
## FAQ

A VPN (Virtual Private Network) changes your IP and keeps you private online.

When you're on public WiFi (vulnerable to attacks), behind a firewall (to unblock sites and circumvent censorship), or to bypass geo-restrictions (streaming services).

Yes, we use AES-256, the maximum-security public cipher trusted by the FBI, CIA, NSA, US government, US military, and many other organizations.    
4. Is FlyVPN a no-log VPN?  
Yes, this is a completely FOSS (Free and Open Source) project, we would never log your data as we respect your privacy as much as our privacy.
